# RecipeBook

**is a simple personal project built with React.**

- It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in 2020 when the initial version included only few dummy predefined recipes, saved in local storage, allowing the user to edit, create and save more for later comeback.

- The project have been upgraded in 2024 when recipes fetching functionality from [tasty.co](https://tasty.co) API have been included. Also, layout have been improved along with other new features added like filtering, pagination and modals.
